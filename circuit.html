<p>This is a LED light lit up by a circuit on a breadboard. The circuit is made up of a jumper cable connected to 5 volts of electricity, a resistor, an LED light, and a jumper cable connected to ground. The pieces of the circuit must be placed in a stair-step pattern because electricity flows from positive to negative down the breadboard. Electricity flows through the circuit and lights up the LED light.</p>
